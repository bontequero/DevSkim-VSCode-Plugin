These are typically scenarios that *could* be incredibly severe if tainted data can be inserted, but are often programmatically necessary (for example, dynamic code generation with \"eval\").  Since these rules tend to require further analysis upon flagging an issue, they disabled by default."

For example //DevSkim: reviewed DS123321 on 2016-12-10 by <whatever this value is>.  If left blank the \"by <whatever this value is>\" is ommitted when marking a finding reviewed."
